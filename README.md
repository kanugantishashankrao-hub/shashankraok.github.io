CAE Analyst | Simulation Engineer | Automation Enthusiast

🌍 Based in Munich, Germany
💻 Passionate about combining Finite Element Analysis (FEA), Python automation, and AI to accelerate engineering simulation workflows.

🚀 About Me

I’m a Mechanical Engineer specialized in Vehicle Safety and Numerical Simulation, with hands-on experience in:

Crash & Safety Analysis (LS-DYNA)

Pedestrian Protection (FlexPLI, Upper Legform)

Automating Preprocessing in ANSA with Python

Simulation Data Management and Optimization

AI/ML Applications in FEM

Currently, I’m exploring how Artificial Intelligence and Automation can transform traditional simulation workflows — from preprocessing and meshing to result interpretation.

🧠 What I Work On

🔹 Developing Python scripts for ANSA automation (meshing, model setup, and post-processing)

🔹 Creating efficient CAE pipelines integrating LS-DYNA, ANSA, and Python

🔹 Exploring AI-assisted simulation and data-driven engineering

🔹 Building tools for automated report generation and simulation quality checks
